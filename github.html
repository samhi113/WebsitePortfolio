            <p class="textOnlySec">Below, you will find a list of projects that I have contributed to or fully created on my own on GitHub. While these are good representatives of my work, many repositories may be outdated, broken, or may show information that do not reflect my beliefs. While I am diligent in how I express myself and who I allow to collaborate with me, I may not be perfect in my efforts. Please proceed with caution in your interpretation of the works listed below.</p>
            
            <p class="bodySubtitle">Nextech Portfolio</p>
            <p class="textOnlySec linkText"><a href="oldSite/index.html" target="_blank">Link to Portfolio</a></p>
            <p class="textOnlySec">After a lengthy search process, I recovered my portfolio from my time at Nextech! Mind you, this was the culmination of a 5-week program where we learned HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Not much time went into the planning process as much as went into the making of the site itself. However, this site won third place overall in our group of nearly 30. I've since made small tweaks to the site's content but mostly left the structure intact. So, if you wish to see the humble beginnings of this incredible coder, you can at the link above!</p>
            
            <p class="bodySubtitle">IU/Information Infrastructure 1/2</p>
            <p class="textOnlySec">In Info Infrastructure 1 & 2, our submissions would be via GitHub folders, which means you can see the various questions we were tasked with throught the two semesters. These tasks include several different questions that got increasingly more difficult as the semester went on, with the intent of teaching us applicable ways to use our newly-found knowledge of various Python elements, modules, and libraries. In Info Infr 1, we moved through standard Python elements, mostly using vanilla Python, and occasionally a module here and there as need be. In Info Infr 2, our focus shifted to the study of libraries, namely NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy. We also began working moreso with pre-generated data provided to us to manipulate, analyze, and draw conclusions from.</p>
            
            <p class="bodySubtitle">Tidbyt Indycar App</p>
            <p class="textOnlySec">One of my biggest passions is racing. Since I was young, my two largest hobbies have been experimenting on the computer and watching racing. During the 2023 Indycar season, I bought and set up a Tidbyt, a 64x32 LED display that has a decently sized developer community, with the company producing the devices allowing for apps to be uploaded and shared among the community. While I was developing an Indycar app of my own, another, more automated solution was uploaded and accepted by the lead developers for public use. I reached out to the developer, discussed the app, and offered assistance with further features, mostly the individual track map designs. My work is now public and viewable on the device, as well as the link below.</p>
