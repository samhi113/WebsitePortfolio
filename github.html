            <p class="textOnlySec">Below, you will find a list of projects that I have contributed to or fully created on my own on GitHub. While these are good representatives of my work, many repositories may be outdated, broken, or may show information that do not reflect my beliefs. While I am diligent in how I express myself and who I allow to collaborate with me, I may not be perfect in my efforts. Please proceed with caution in your interpretation of the works listed below.</p>
            
            <p class="bodySubtitle">Nextech Portfolio</p>
            <p class="textOnlySec linkText"><a href="oldSite/index.html" target="_blank">Link to Portfolio</a></p>
            <p class="textOnlySec">After a lengthy search process, I recovered my portfolio from my time at Nextech! Mind you, this was the culmination of a 5-week program where we learned HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Not much time went into the planning process as much as went into the making of the site itself. However, this site won third place overall in our group of nearly 30. I've since made small tweaks to the site's content but mostly left the structure intact.</p>
            
            <p class="bodySubtitle">Walker Career Center</p>
            <p class="textOnlySec">Summer job provided by graphic design teacher and print shop manager at Walker Career Center. During my classwork, I learned how to design, create, and deliver products to customers, which my teacher then followed up with a job offer after I had concluded my semester. During my time in the print shop, I learned the logistics of the school system and the work made at the shop, how to digitize and recreate preexisting documents, and how to efficiently and successfully create hundreds, if not thousands of deliverables throughout a day's work. The job was seasonal, with my last day coming a week before I was to begin classes.</p>
            
            <p class="bodySubtitle">IUPUI / IU Indianapolis</p>
            <p class="textOnlySec">During my time as a student at IUPUI, I worked as an IT Consultant for TCC, a division of UITS. During my time there, I assisted in the upkeep and documentation of the computer labs around campus; helped students, professors, and faculty with their various tech issues; and gave technology advice to anyone who requested it on campus. I started my fall semester of freshamn year, and earned Consultant of the Semester for both semesters as well as the following summer. I currently am on the waitlist for both a Supervisor and Office Assistant position, which are  the largest roles a full-time student can pick up within our division.</p>
