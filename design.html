            <p>I mean, look at it. A definition of who I am and my stylistic preferences. Meanwhile, I balance usability and interactivity into various elements, such as hover effects and HTML development. Don't even get me started on the simplicity of the site. How much data is the entire site? 1.21MB. Yes, you read that right. This entire site, which is extremely professional, and aesthetically pleasing, is fast enough to load every single webpage on this site in just about a second, on 3G internet. The images and your ability to read are the only parts slowing down your experience. If I can cram this much into a site so small, imagine what I could do with a much higher amount of resources and constant information to share.</p>
            
            <p class="bodySubtitle">IU Indianapolis Branding Sprint</p>
            <div alt="A logo Sam designed for IUPUI's athletics transition to IU Indianapolis." title="A logo I proposed for IU Indianapolis and it's athletics program." class="wrapImg wrapImgLeft" style="background-image: url(https://i.postimg.cc/htrY4m4X/IUI-Logo.png);"></div>
            <p>In the fall of 2022, I participated in a 24-hour branding sprint with IU Indianapolis. The logo above and works below are my work, which was heavily inspired by the organic and modern feel of campus, as it pushes closer towards the future. The jersey and other elements were inspired by the University Library's 45-degree windows at the building's top. It can be seen in the sides of both the jersey and the basketball court. <br> <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Z_gqHVIR5TT0oZsmriXSQvLsBYKKbmXi?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> The work can be found here. </a> </p>

            <p>In the fall of 2023, I applied for TechPoint's Xtern program, which aims to connect aspiring youth in college with nearby companies to build the local tech industry while promoting youth, service, and community engagement. I had passed the first step of Xtern's application, and was instructed to create deliverables for a work assessment. The topic was FoodX, a theoretical food promotion program that helped promote tech, food, and culture in Indianapolis. To the right and at the link below, you can find a sample of my work. <br> <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qO0ldXzC4M3U8tGdD9ALZeFem8PgSRED?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> The collection of work can be found here. </a> </p>
