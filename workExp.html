            <p>From July 2020 to March 2021, I worked at McAlister's Deli, mostly in the front of house, doing various jobs. I mostly worked at the register, taking orders and filling drinks for customers who need it. I left after the working environment soured, leaving me burnt out from constant overworking and little to no enjoyment in what I did.</p>

            <p>Summer internship in Downtown Indianapolis. Program ran for 5 weeks, my colleagues and I heard from multiple people in the tech industry, learned about the growing number of opportunities in Indianapolis, and put together portfolio websites, which can still be seen at <a href="https://samhi113.github.io/WebsitePortfolio/oldSite/" target="_blank" class="underlineLink">the following site</a>. Studied HTML, CSS, and jQuery from an accredited Computer Science teacher. The aforementioned site won third place among my colleagues, as analyzed by the tech industry leaders we heard from throughout the 5 weeks. The internship wrapped up after we presented our portfolios.</p>

            <p>Summer job provided by graphic design teacher and print shop manager at Walker Career Center. During my classwork, I learned how to design, create, and deliver products to customers, which my teacher then followed up with a job offer after I had concluded my semester. During my time in the print shop, I learned the logistics of the school system and the work made at the shop, how to digitize and recreate preexisting documents, and how to efficiently and successfully create hundreds, if not thousands of deliverables throughout a day's work. The job was seasonal, with my last day coming a week before I was to begin classes.</p>

            <p>During my time as a student at IUPUI, I worked as an IT Consultant for TCC, a division of UITS. During my time there, I assisted in the upkeep and documentation of the computer labs around campus; helped students, professors, and faculty with their various tech issues; and gave technology advice to anyone who requested it on campus. I started my fall semester of freshamn year, and earned Consultant of the Semester for both semesters as well as the following summer. I currently am on the waitlist for both a Supervisor and Office Assistant position, which are  the largest roles a full-time student can pick up within our division.</p>
